  ## Description
   Through the use of React, I was able to create a single page portfolio.  The portfolio will include a home page containing information about me the developer, a contact page which will allow users to send me an email, a portfolio page demonstrating some projects that I've worked on, and lastly a resume page which will allow a user to download a PDF version of my resume while still being able to see what languages I am proficient in.
