The goal was to create a travel journal app where users could document their experiences and attach images. Built using the MERN stack, my primary responsibility was implementing user authentication for login and signup functionality. With growing confidence and experience, I was able to complete that quickly and later contributed to additional features, including image upload capabilities using preset stock images."

Built using the MERN stack, the goal was to modernize the backend architecture while preserving core functionality. I implemented an Apollo Server to handle GraphQL queries and mutations for data retrieval and updates, replaced the existing RESTful endpoints, and adapted the authentication middleware to function within the GraphQL context. Additionally, I configured an Apollo Provider on the frontend to facilitate communication with the GraphQL server, and deployed the final application to Render using a MongoDB database."

Built entirely from scratch, it displays a randomly selected developer profile on the homepage. Users can either save or skip a candidate based on their own criteria. Skipping triggers the display of a new, randomly generated candidate. A built-in search bar allows users to actively search for potential candidates as well. Saved profiles are accessible via the 'Saved Candidates' button, where users can view or remove previously saved candidates."

We built a simple, interactive front-end game where users aim to generate as much virtual currency as possible. As users accumulate more money, they can purchase upgrades to boost their earnings. It was a fun and engaging project that introduced key concepts like client-side storage, and served as a great introduction to team based development."

            description: "While this app may currently be inactive due to database hosting issues, it was my second project during bootcamp and my first full-stack collaborative experience. Our team built a mock restaurant reservation application using Node.js, Express.js, and React to create a RESTful API. We used PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM for the database. My primary role focused on implementing user authentication using JWTs for signup and login functionality. I also integrated the Resend API to send confirmation emails to users upon successful registration and reservation. This project was a great opportunity to deepen my understanding of backend development and teamwork in a full-stack environment."

Built using the MERN stack, the application allows users to take notes and upload multiple images to help visualize and organize their thoughts. I personally use it as a to-do checklist to track ongoing tasks and ideas for future projects. While the core functionality is solid, there are a few UI elements I plan to refine, so you can expect minor improvements and feature upgrades over time."
